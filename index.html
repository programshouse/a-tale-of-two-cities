                In 1843, one of Dickens’ most famous works was published- ‘A
                Christmas Carol’. In this story, it was particularly clear that
                Dickens was becoming increasingly disappointed with the social
                philosophy of his time. Much that was bad in society, he
                believed, was a result of an obsession with money and the social
                status that came from money.

                Dickens travelled abroad in the 1840s, first to America and then
                to Europe. A new stage in his life began. His novels were more
                serious and more carefully planned. ‘David Copperfield’,
                published 1849- 50, was similar to the story of Dickens’ own
                life. Readers of the novel experienced the same imperfect world
                that Dickens had experienced

                Dickens also started several weekly magazines in which he
                published his novels, including ‘A Tale of Two Cities’.

                Dickens first had the idea of a novel set during the French
                Revolution when he read the book ‘The French Revolution’ by
                Thomas Carlyle. The novel was published in Dickens’ new weekly
                magazine ‘All the Year Round’ in 1859. It was popular for both
                its short length and its strong themes. 1859 was a time of great
                change for Dickens— he separated from his wife. Dickens began a
                series of public readings of his works in 1858.

                The hard work involved caused his health to become worse, and on
                the ninth of June 1870, Dickens died. He was buried in Poets’
                Corner, Westminster Abbey, London. He had written fifteen
                complete novels and many short works.

                  Charles Dickens “A Tale of Two Cities” stands as an enduring
                  masterpiece of historical fiction, weaving a compelling
                  narrative against the backdrop of the French Revolution.
                  Published in 1859, the novel captures the essence of an era
                  characterized by social unrest, political upheaval, and the
                  stark dichotomy between privilege and destitution. With a
                  masterful blend of intricate storytelling and social
                  commentary, Dickens delivers a poignant exploration of love,
                  sacrifice, and the inexorable march of fate.

                The Dover mail coach made its way slowly up the muddy hillside.
                The late November night was cold and foggy. The passengers
                walked beside the coach. The carriage was so heavy and slow from
                the mud stuck to its wheels that it would not have ever reached
                the top of the hill if the passengers sat inside. The horses had

                Saint Antoine was one of the poorest parts of Paris. Hunger was
                written on the face of every man and woman there, and the
                children had the sad faces of old men. The shops only sold the

                over the rough stones and small pools of it were formed in the
                cracks between them.

                The quiet voice spoke again. “It is a young lady s shoe. It is
                of the present fashion. But I have never seen a shoe like this.
                I have only seen the pattern.” He looked at the shoe with a

                He dropped his knife, bent down to pick it up, and noticed
                Lucie’s dress. He looked at her closely. “Who are you?” he

                Lucie could not speak. She sat down next to the old man on the
                bench. He moved away from her, but she put her hand on his arm.
                He dropped his knife and sat looking at her. Lucie’s golden hair
                fell onto his shoulder. Slowly, he put out his hand to touch it.
                Then he breathed deeply and continued with his shoe-making.

                Tellson’s Bank in London was an
                <strong>old-fashioned</strong> place, even in 1780. It was
                small, dark, and ugly, but its owners liked it that way. They
                believed that if it looked any better, it would be less
                respectable. Inside, all the men were very old. A young man
                joined the bank he was kept hidden until he was old and had the
                full Tellson flavour.

                that showed on his face, and in his eyes. That day’s
                <strong>trial</strong> was just such a reminder. Only his
                daughter had the power to break the painful spell, and restore
                the Doctor to peace.

                good jackal, and a very good servant to Stryver. He had always
                been that way. Even when he was at school, he had done exercises
                for the other boys instead of doing his own.

                The corner where the house stood was a wonderful corner for
                hearing
                <strong>echoes</strong>, and just then it began to echo with the
                sound of footsteps, as if caused by the simple mention of
                walking.

                “They are here,” said Miss Pross. “And there will be hundreds of
                people here soon.” Miss Pross was a pleasant sight as she took
                off Lucie’s bonnet when she came upstairs. Lucie was a pleasant
                sight, as she <strong>embraced</strong> Miss Pross and thanked
                her. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too, happy to find himself
                in a home in his <strong>declining years</strong>.

                Dinner-time came, and no hundreds of people had appeared. After
                dinner, Lucie suggested that they sit outside. Still, no

                “I have been there,” said Darnay with a bitter tone. “I was kept
                there as a prisoner, but as a prisoner I actually didn’t have
                the chance to see very much of it. While I was there, they told

                “Some workmen had found an old, forgotten room. On the wall was
                the word “dig,” written by a prisoner. So they looked under the
                floor and found some paper. They couldn’t read what the prisoner
                had written, but he had written something.”

                Dr. Manette had suddenly jumped up and was holding his hand to
                his head. “No,’ he said, “I am not ill. It is raining. The rain
                surprised me. We had better go inside.” Mr. Lorry thought he
                could see the same strange look on the Doctor’s face that he had
                seen outside the court.

                Many people were in the streets, hurrying to get home before the
                storm began. The house, in the wonderful corner for echoes, was
                filled with the sound of footsteps, but there were no people to
                be seen outside.

                into our lives.” “I see the crowd rushing towards us—by the
                lighting I can see them—” said Charles Darnay, and lightning
                <strong>flashed</strong> as he said these words. “And I hear

                It was dark when the Marquis arrived at his
                <strong>chateau</strong>. It was a cold and heavy-looking
                building made of stone. Stone steps led to the great stone
                doors, as stone faced lions and men looked in this direction and
                that. An owl made a loud cry in the trees above as the Marquis
                made his way up the wide, stone steps, and all else was again
                quiet.

                The door was opened for him and he crossed a wide hall, filled
                with swords, spears, knives, riding-whips and other weapons for
                hunting. Many a poor peasant had felt the
                <strong>lashing</strong> from these weapons, and had gone to his
                death, when the Marquis was angry.

                With a servant carrying a light in front of him, the Marquis
                went up the staircase to a door in a corridor. He went through
                this door and into his three private rooms. A supper table was
                laid for two in one of the rooms. “I don’t suppose Charles will
                come tonight, but leave the table as it is,” said the Marquis.

                family,” the Marquis replied. “<strong>Repression</strong> is
                the only lasting philosophy. As long as this roof above me shuts

                The sun was shining brightly on the morning of the marriage of
                Lucie Manette to Charles Darnay. Darnay was speaking to the

                saddened her. Her brother, Solomon, who had robbed her and
                disappeared many years before, but whom she still loved, was not
                to be Lucie’s husband.

                and careless man. Later, when Charles and Lucie were alone,
                Charles saw a look of serious thought on his wife s face.

                London home, bloodied feet echoed through the streets of Paris.

                could be used to smash, fire and kill.

                Madame Defarge was there with a long knife, and with that knife
                she cut off the man’s head. And so the
                <strong> Revolution</strong> began. On that same day, all of the
                prisoners of the Bastille were released and the guards were

                One misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry was sitting at his desk in the
                bank. Charles Darnay was <strong>leaning</strong> on the desk,
                talking to Jarvis Lorry in a low voice.

                Charles Darnay made his way slowly to Paris. Every town gate and
                village had its group of citizen-patriots with guns ready, who
                stopped everyone who came or went, questioned them,
                <strong>inspected</strong>
                their papers, looked for their names on lists, turned them back
                or sent them on, or took them in as they thought best for the
                new Republic of France.

                Darnay soon realized that he would not be allowed to return to
                England until he had been <strong>declared</strong> a good
                citizen in Paris. Whatever might happen, he must go on to the
                end of his journey. Every gate that closed behind him was, he
                knew, another gate between him and England.

                He was stopped twenty times in a day. He had been on the road
                for several days and was still a long way from Paris. Nothing
                but Gabelle’s letter would have allowed him to go so far. He
                went to bed tired out, in a small town, and was not surprised
                when he was woken up in the middle of the night by a local
                official and three armed patriots. They wore rough red caps, and
                had pipes in their mouths.

                “You have no choice,” said the official. “Rise and dress
                yourself, emigrant.” Darnay was taken to the guard-house where
                other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking and
                sleeping by a fire. He paid a heavy price for his escort and
                started out with it along the wet roads at three o’clock in the
                morning.

                Two patriots on horseback, wearing red caps and armed with guns
                and swords, rode on either side of Darnay. In this way they
                travelled the great distance along wet,
                <strong>muddy</strong> roads to Paris. Each guard was so poorly
                clothed that they had <strong>twisted</strong> straw around
                their bare legs to keep the wet off.

                They reached the town of Beauvais when the streets were filled
                with people. There, Charles Darnay was shown the seriousness of
                his situation. A crowd gathered to see him. Shouts came at him
                from all sides:
              </p>

                “Friends!” Darnay called, “Don’t you see that I am here on my
                own will? I am no <strong>traitor</strong>.” “Lies! You are a
                traitor since the new law! Death to the emigrant!” The crowd
                continued to shout as Darnay and his escort went again on their
                way to Paris. At last they reached the city’s walls. The gate
                was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.

                Upset by these words, Darnay told the guard that he was not a
                prisoner but a free man who had travelled with an escort that he
                had paid for. The guard took no notice of him. “Where are the
                papers of this prisoner?” he demanded again.

                One of the red-capped patriots produced the papers. The guard
                was surprised when he saw Gabelle’s letter. He looked closely at

                Tellson’s Bank in Paris was in a part of a large house, facing a
                courtyard and shut off from the street by a high fence and a
                gate. When Jarvis Lorry arrived in Paris, he took rooms in this
                building.

                One night, on the third of September, he opened a window and
                looked onto the courtyard. There he saw the
                <strong>grindstone</strong>, which had been put in the location
                for a special and bloody purpose. Mr. Lorry shivered at the
                sight, closed the window, and sat by the fire.

                Mr. Lorry immediately went out to find suitable rooms. When he
                had found some, he took Lucie, her daughter and Miss Pross to
                them. He left Jerry Cruncher with them for protection, and
                returned to the bank, where he worked until closing time.

                He was sitting alone in his room when he heard footsteps on the

                Soon they came to the stairs to Lucie’s rooms. Inside they found
                her <strong>weeping</strong> and alone. At the news of her
                husband, she was filled with joy. She read the note delivered by

                Lucie was so happy that she turned from Ernest Defarge to his
                wife and kissed one of the hands that was knitting. It was an
                action of <strong>sincere</strong> thankfulness and love, but
                the hand fell, cold and heavy, and returned to its knitting.
                There was something about this that frightened Lucie. She gave
                Madame Defarge a terrified look. Madame Defarge looked coldly

                troubled. “What way is that to think? Be brave, there is nothing
                to worry about in that shadow.”

                Lucie, he did not tell her about the terrible things he had seen
                in the prison. He didn’t tell her that he had seen more than one
                thousand prisoners killed in those four days. But he told Mr.
                Lorry everything.

                In the prison, he had found a kind of court which decided if the
                prisoners would be set free, killed, or sent back to their
                cells. The Doctor told the court that he had been a prisoner in
                the Bastille, and Defarge had recognised him. Then he asked for
                Darnay to be brought to the court. For some reason, which the
                Doctor did not know, the court refused to set Darnay free, but
                agreed that he would be kept in prison and not killed. The
                Doctor had stayed at the prison to protect Darnay.

                When Mr. Lorry heard the Doctor’s story, he was afraid that the

                soon it became clear that he had found new

                Days, weeks, and months passed. Doctor Manette continued to work
                as physician at the prisons, and he continued to do what he
                could for Charles Darnay. Meanwhile the King was killed— his
                head was cut from his body by the<strong> guillotine.</strong>
                Prisons over flowed with prisoners: men, women, young and old,
                guilty and innocent alike. And all along, the sharp guillotine
                cut off so many heads that the earth beneath it was
                <strong>stained </strong> red.

                The time went by like currents in the sea. Among the horrors,
                Doctor Manette remained steady, strong and confident. For one
                year and three months Lucie lived with the fear that her husband
                might suffer the same fate as so many others.

                One evening, the Doctor told Lucie that there was a window in
                the prison that Darnay could sometimes go to at three in the
                afternoon. “He might be able to see you in the street if you
                stand in a certain place that I will show you, he said. But you

                The place was the corner of a small street, near a woodcutter’s
                hut. Lucie went there every day at two and left at four. When

                father. Mr. Lorry came from his room, and he had a troubled look
                on his face, and a troubled sound to his voice. When the Doctor
                told him the news, Mr. Lorry seemed to repeat the words loudly
                for the unseen visitor in the other room: “He will be tried at
                the court tomorrow?”

                The next day, fifteen prisoners were tried before it was Charles
                Darnay’s turn. They were all sent to the Guillotine. The trials
                were short. The fifteen trials took only an hour and a half.

                Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused under the law that

                Mr. Lorry looked into the fire. He was
                <strong>filled with</strong> sympathy for Lucie, and he was
                deeply disappointed by the second arrest of her husband. He was
                an old man now, and he had been through too much worry in
                <strong>recent</strong> days. Tears began to fall from his eyes.

                Carton’s last comment was a slip back to his old behaviour. But,
                in the rest of his words, Mr. Lorry saw a side of the man that
                he had not expected. He gave him his hand, and Sydney Carton
                pressed it gently.

                I, Alexandre Manette, physician, am writing these words in my
                cell in the Bastille in the last month of 1767. I will hide the
                paper in a hole in the chimney which I have made for it. I hope
                that someone will find it when I am dead. I am writing, with
                difficulty, using soot from the chimney mixed with blood. I am
                using a <strong> rusty</strong> iron point as my pen. I no

                what had happened, but did not know the girl was dead. She had

                thought that the paper had been destroyed when the Bastille was
                taken, or maybe he had forgotten about it. He asked Lucie to
                comfort her father and not let him
                <strong>blame</strong> himself for what had
                happened.

                He also wrote to Doctor Manette and Mr. Lorry. He asked the
                Doctor to look after his wife and child, hoping that the request
                would prevent the Doctor from suffering relapses in the future.
                He thanked Mr. Lorry for his friendship and trusted him with his
                money. He did not write to Carton; he did not even think of the
                man; his mind was so full of the others who were so close to
                him.

                The lights were put out. The room was dark. Darnay lay down,
                thinking that he had finished with the world. But the world came
                back to him in his sleep. He dreamt that he was back in London, happy, 
with Lucie and their daughter. Then he woke up, and lay awake for a 
while. Then he lay, half asleep, half awake. The night passed slowly.

                not afraid of. He heard doors being opened, one after another.
                Then his own door was opened. A prison guard, with a list in his

      The ruthless woman made her way through the streets. Hidden in her dress were a loaded gun and a sharp knife. There was no pity in her heart. It did not matter to her that an innocent man was going to die. It did not matter that a wife was going to lose her husband, and a child her father.

      When Mr. Lorry had planned the journey the night before, he had thought it best that Jerry Cruncher and Miss Pross should follow in another coach. The fewer people there were, the faster the coach would travel; the fewer passengers, the less time would be spent having their papers examined. Jerry Cruncher and Miss Pross would start after the
    others, but, being in a lighter carriage, would soon catch up with them. 
They would be able to go on ahead and order fresh horses at every 
town. <strong> Valuable </strong> time would be saved

      Jerry and Miss Pross were getting ready to leave as Madame Defarge was walking to the house. They had seen the other carriage start on its journey and they knew the truth of the man brought by Solomon; they knew that it was Charles Darnay.

      Jerry Cruncher went out, leaving Miss Pross by herself. She looked at her watch. It was twenty past two. She had no time to lose. She got a bowl of water and began to wash her face. Her eyes were red and <strong class="bold">swollen</strong> from her tears. As she looked up, she gave a cry.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/128/8.mp3">
      Madame Defarge stood in the middle of the room.

      The wash-basin fell to the floor and broke. Water <strong class="bold">flowed</strong> to the feet of Madame Defarge. “Where is the wife of Evremonde?” said Madame Defarge, looking coldly at Miss Pross.

      Miss Pross did not want Madame Defarge to know that the house was empty. She quickly shut all the doors. Then she stood in front of the door to the room that had once been Lucie’s.

      Madame Defarge watched her doing this and looked angrily at her when she had finished. Miss Pross returned her angry look. Both

strong. Miss Pross’s strength came from love.

      Each woman spoke in her own language. Neither understood the other’s language, but they each understood enough. Madame Defarge knew that Miss Pross was the family’s <strong class="bold">devoted</strong> friend. Miss Pross knew that Madame Defarge was the family’s most dangerous enemy.

      Miss Pross was now so full of anger and excitement that tears came into her eyes. Madame Defarge could not understand the source of her courage, and mistook the tears as a sign of weakness. She laughed. “Ha, ha! You miserable thing!” She raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Answer me, someone! Anyone but this miserable fool, answer Madame Defarge!”
